# RAG Travel Recommender: Understanding & Achievement Milestones

This guide helps you track your understanding and achievements as you build the project. Use it alongside the timed sessions in LEARNING_JOURNEY.md to ensure thorough understanding.

## Core Concept Milestones

### Understanding RAG
Ask Claude until you can explain:
- How RAG differs from regular AI responses
- Why RAG is useful for recommendations
- How RAG improves result quality

### Understanding Vector Embeddings
Ask Claude until you can explain:
- Why regular text search isn't enough
- How embeddings represent meaning
- Why similar meanings have similar numbers

### Understanding pgvector
Ask Claude until you can explain:
- Why we need a vector database
- How pgvector stores embeddings
- How similarity search works

### Understanding Weights
Ask Claude until you can explain:
- Why some matches should count more than others
- How weights improve recommendations
- When to adjust weights

## Technical Achievement Milestones

### 1. Database Foundation
You've succeeded when you can:
- ✓ Connect to PostgreSQL
- ✓ Create tables with vector columns
- ✓ Load the Mountains vs Beaches dataset
- ✓ Run basic vector operations

Key Questions for Claude:
- "How do I verify pgvector is working correctly?"
- "What's the best way to structure my tables?"
- "How should I organize my travel data?"

### 2. Embedding Implementation
You've succeeded when you can:
- ✓ Generate embeddings from text
- ✓ Store embeddings in pgvector
- ✓ Retrieve embeddings successfully
- ✓ Explain what the embeddings represent

Key Questions for Claude:
- "How do I create meaningful embeddings?"
- "What makes a good embedding?"
- "How do I test embedding quality?"

### 3. Recommendation System
You've succeeded when you can:
- ✓ Find similar profiles
- ✓ Apply appropriate weights
- ✓ Return logical recommendations
- ✓ Handle edge cases

Key Questions for Claude:
- "How do I improve match quality?"
- "What makes a good recommendation?"
- "How do I handle unusual cases?"

### 4. Frontend Integration
You've succeeded when you can:
- ✓ Accept user inputs properly
- ✓ Make API calls correctly
- ✓ Display recommendations clearly
- ✓ Handle errors gracefully

Key Questions for Claude:
- "How should I structure my components?"
- "What's the best way to show recommendations?"
- "How do I handle loading and errors?"

## Problem-Solving Checkpoints

When stuck, ensure you can:
1. Clearly describe the problem
2. Explain what you've tried
3. Share relevant error messages
4. Ask Claude specific questions

## Understanding Checks

Regularly verify you can:
1. Explain concepts to others
2. Predict system behavior
3. Identify potential issues
4. Suggest improvements

Remember: These milestones aren't just about making features work - they're about understanding how and why things work. Take time to achieve true understanding at each step.
