# Building a RAG-based Travel Recommender: Learning Journey

## Understanding the Building Blocks

Before writing any code, understand these core concepts by discussing with Claude:
1. What is RAG and how does it work?
2. What are vector embeddings and why do we need them?
3. How does pgvector enable similarity search?
4. What are weights and when should we use them?

## Development Journey

### Phase 1: Database Foundation
Start by asking Claude about:
- Setting up PostgreSQL with pgvector
- Understanding the Mountains vs Beaches dataset
- Planning your database schema
- Converting and loading the data

Key Questions for Claude:
- "How should I structure my database tables for a RAG system?"
- "What fields from the dataset are most important for recommendations?"
- "How do I test if pgvector is working correctly?"

### Phase 2: Vector Operations
Work with Claude to understand:
- Creating embeddings from user preferences
- Storing embeddings in pgvector
- Implementing similarity search
- Testing vector operations

Key Questions:
- "How do I create meaningful embeddings from travel preferences?"
- "What makes a good similarity search query?"
- "How can I test if my similarity matching is working?"

### Phase 3: Recommendation Logic
Explore with Claude:
- When and why to use weights
- How to handle edge cases
- Improving recommendation quality
- Adding rate limiting

Key Questions:
- "What combinations of preferences should have higher weights?"
- "How can I make my recommendations more logical?"
- "When should I implement rate limiting?"

### Phase 4: Frontend Development
Discuss with Claude:
- Planning the user interface
- Handling form inputs effectively
- Displaying recommendations
- Error handling and loading states

Key Questions:
- "How should I structure my React components?"
- "What's the best way to handle the API calls?"
- "How can I make the UI user-friendly?"

## Learning Milestones

### Milestone 1: Database Setup
You should be able to:
- Set up PostgreSQL with pgvector
- Load and query the dataset
- Create and store test embeddings

### Milestone 2: Basic Recommendations
You should be able to:
- Generate embeddings from user input
- Find similar profiles using vector similarity
- Return basic recommendations

### Milestone 3: Enhanced Features
You should be able to:
- Apply logical weights to recommendations
- Handle edge cases and errors
- Implement rate limiting

### Milestone 4: Complete Application
You should be able to:
- Accept user input through a form
- Display recommendations clearly
- Handle errors gracefully
- Provide a smooth user experience

## Tips for Working with Claude

1. Ask About Concepts First
- Get Claude to explain concepts before implementation
- Ask for examples and analogies
- Make sure you understand WHY before HOW

2. Iterative Development
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Test each piece thoroughly
- Ask Claude to explain any unexpected behavior

3. Problem Solving
- Describe issues clearly
- Share error messages
- Ask about alternative approaches

4. Learning Checks
- Explain concepts back to Claude
- Ask for verification of your understanding
- Request challenges to test your knowledge

Remember: The goal is to understand and learn, not just copy solutions. Use Claude as a guide to help you discover and understand the implementation details yourself.
